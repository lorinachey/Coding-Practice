### Practice Exercises for C++ 20 Fundamentals

This workspace is for practicing with the new features of C++ 20 and for reviewing core C++ concepts along the way. The files in this directory (and subdirectories) are modifications of the exercise files included in Paul Deitel's C++ 20 Fundamentals course from Oreilly Media. The course GitHub repo can be accessed [here](https://github.com/pdeitel/CPlusPlus20FundamentalsLiveLessons).

I prefer to write my own exercise files for the practice so I have adapted/combined many of the exercises.
