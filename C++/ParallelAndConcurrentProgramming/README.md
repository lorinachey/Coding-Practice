### Parallel and Concurrent Programming with C++

This directory contains exercise files adpated from the Parallel and Concurrent Programming with C++ courses by Barron and Olivia Stone. This course was originally published on LinkedIn Learning. The course teaches parallel and concurrent programming using examples cooking/kitchen tasks so there are lots of references to food, chefs, and kitchens.

I prefer to re-write and play around with the files accompanying the course to get practice with the topics discussed.
