# Coding-Practice
A repository for practicing code in multiple different languages. This includes practicing design patterns, data structures, and algorithms. It also includes language learning exercise files and tutorials.

### Some Notes
Some things done in this repository are NOT things that I would do in production environments.
A few examples:
* Pushing all changes directly to master
* Not having adequate unit tests
